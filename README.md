Certainly! Here's an improved version of your README file for the Git repository:

# Tweet Sentiment Analysis

This project utilizes a dataset from [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/twitter-coronavirus) to create a fine-tuned model based on the BERT Transformer for multi-class sentiment classification. The goal is to classify text/tweets into one of five sentiment classes:

- Extremely Negative: 0
- Negative: 1
- Neutral: 2
- Positive: 3
- Extremely Positive: 4

## Model Access

You can access the pre-trained model on Hugging Face using the following link:

[Peed911/Roberta_corona_class](https://huggingface.co/Peed911/Roberta_corona_class)

Alternatively, you can use the Hugging Face Transformers library to call the model directly:

```python
# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-classification", model="Peed911/Roberta_corona_class")
```

Or load the model and tokenizer separately:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Peed911/Roberta_corona_class")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("Peed911/Roberta_corona_class")
```

## Repository Contents

This Git repository contains all the files used to build and train the sentiment analysis model.

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training

You can train the model by running the following command:

```
python train.py
```

### Notebooks

For a more detailed understanding of the training and prediction processes, you can use the provided Jupyter notebook. You can run the notebook on platforms like Google Colab or Kaggle with GPU support.

### Inference

For performing inference with the trained model, you have two options:

#### Gradio

To use Gradio for inference, run the following command using the provided demo script:

```
python demo.py
```

#### FastAPI

For FastAPI, run the application using the following command from the root folder:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Ensure that you are in the root folder when executing this command.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. Happy sentiment analysis!
